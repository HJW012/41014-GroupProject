Video Description:

The video outlines the experiments undertaken by the group to complete all the deliverables set out in the project proposal.
Screen recordings were taken at each major 'breakthrough' throughout the project's duration, and these have been included in the final video.
These 'breakthroughs' include:
	- Tracking & localising real-life AR tags
	- Tracking & localising simulated AR tags in the gazebo siulation environment
	- Spawning two TurtleBots in the same simulation
	- Teleoperational control of one of the two TurtleBots
	- Attaching virtual AR tag model to TurtleBot model
	- Orienting follower TurtleBot towards leader TurtleBot using the virtual AR tags
	- Driving follower TurtleBot towards leader TurtleBot
	- Follower TurtleBot properly following leader while being controlled
